## V1 Already Built
`index.html` in this directory is a complete V1. Review it, improve it.

## What To Improve
1. **Polish the design** — make it feel more premium. Subtle animations, better spacing, micro-interactions
2. **Add smooth scroll animations** — sections should fade/slide in as you scroll (use IntersectionObserver, no libraries)
3. **Improve mobile experience** — test at 375px width, make sure everything stacks perfectly
4. **Add a sticky CTA** — subtle floating button that appears after scrolling past the hero
5. **Improve the ROI table on mobile** — it's cramped, maybe switch to cards on small screens
6. **Add hover states** — cards should have subtle lift/glow effects
7. **Performance** — keep it lightweight, no external JS libraries, vanilla only
8. **SEO meta tags** — proper Open Graph tags, structured data (LocalBusiness schema)
9. **Favicon** — use a simple red "CM" or just the red color
10. **Make the FAQ section feel better** — smooth open/close animation

## DO NOT
- Change any copy/text content
- Change the booking link
- Change the pricing
- Add any external libraries/frameworks
- Change the color scheme
- Remove any sections

## Output
Single index.html file with all CSS/JS inline. Should be deployable as-is.
